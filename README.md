# rust-pdf
A pure rust library for generating PDF files.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kaj/rust-pdf.svg?branch=master)]
(https://travis-ci.org/kaj/rust-pdf)

To use this library, add it as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml`:

    [dependencies]
    pdf = "*"

The API is still very alpha, usage may change.  Some examples, that
should work with the version containing them, can be found in the
`examples` directory.
